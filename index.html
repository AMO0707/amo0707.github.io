                        already knew me since like one year ago <img src="emoji/pep_smile.png" class="emoji" /> but
                        anyway

                    <p>I wanted to use a webpage to write it because it sounds interesting and can save you from a wall
                        of
                        texts, definitely not because I want to use Cieru's art as background <img

                        characters are staring at you, they are just a fan. Also you will see a lot of emojis here
                        brought
                        from discord, I love them I couldn't resist not having them here <img

                            src="emoji/jerryPff.png" class="emoji" />). I chose this nickname
                        since 2018 or around, it has some little meaning for each character, coming from A for anime and
                        M
                        for manga because I liked them so much back then XD
                        (still till now but less additive and don't have much time to it as before), O is just there no
                        specific reason, just because AM look weird alone.</p>

                <section class="content-section" data-index="15">
                    <p>And my nickname amo doesn't mean anything else in
                        any other
                        language <img src="emoji/concern.png" class="emoji" />, I knew not so long time ago that it have
                        a
                        different meaning in some languages but no, my
                        nickname doesn't mean love and definitely not me I am more logical person than emotional (at
                        least
                        not showing them <img src="emoji/kermit_think.png" class="emoji" /> or maybe yes with emojis
                        idk)
                        but
                        of course not it doesnt mean that.</p>
                    <p>I thought about changing it but I couldn't think of any other nicknames and I am too used to it
                        now,
                        and still like it, so I will still be be amo until who knows when</p>

                    <p>I live in Qassim, it's in the middle area of saudi arabia far away from the seas. It specialized
                        in
                        dates (and other
                        crops that I actually see their fields but I just knew that we farm also grapes, lmeons and
                        other
                        things with this
                        hot-sunny weather here <img src="emoji/psysweat.png" class="emoji" />). Dates are the dates
                        fruit,
                        not a date, well you got it. Google says qassim supplies dates to different 74 countries, If you
                        were in one of them and like dates go buy ours, I recommend it 100% it's good and the best <img
                            src="emoji/white_man_good.png" class="emoji" /> (actually I haven't
                        tried other than qassim dates so I wouldn't know <img src="emoji/concern.png" class="emoji" />)
                    </p>
                    <p> Even if you don't like them just try some they are healthy <img src="emoji/nodeKoha.gif"
                            class="emoji" />. Also there is so many types of dates, if
                        you don't like one you may like another so just try it. Personally I used to not like it but I
                        am
                        used to it now,
                        can't say its my favorite but I eat it from to time because it's healthy.</p>

                        of chatting suddenly sounds hard and consuming my energy even if I would love it <img

                        x
                        Hunter. Also most remarkable anime that made me laugh alot was The Disastrous Life of Saiki K,

                        soo funny <img src="emoji/haha.gif" class="emoji" />. There's also one unpopular aninme that I
                        like a lot, idk if it's popular or not but I have never heard someone talk about it, it called
                        Hikaru no Go <img src="emoji/potate_wow.png" class="emoji" /> I miss it now maybe I will rewatch
                        it
                        for the 5th time (I am being carefull with how many I rewatch things so I don't remember
                        everything
                        from watching it too many times or I
                        would rewartch it 100 times alreay <img src="emoji/awoo.png" class="emoji" />)</p>
                    <p>There's a lot much more animes names to list and talk about here but that will probaly take me

                        I havent played a lot of games but I have some games that I get fall to in the past for
                        sometime,
                        like I become a
                        big fan of that game for a couple of years, and loyal enough to play only that game during that
                        xD,
                        minecraft, pubg moblie, genshin impact and now nnk, those are the ones I remember I spent much
                        time
                        with them, also there's some other smaller moblie games. but I am getting more into games
                        recently I
                        am playing other games than nnk like nintendo switch games and

                        Now to the food corrner <img src="emoji/fire.gif" class="emoji" /> I am a bit of picky eater and
                        will write here what I like and don't like of any kind of food I think about. I have no idea why
                        I
                        am even writing it in all details, but anyway I said I will make this intro long enough so I
                        should keep my promise <img src="emoji/creepySmile.png" class="emoji" />

                        repeating what said in very first few paragraphs, my favorite food is pasta all kind or type of
                        it
                        Idk what they called but all kind of pasta are delicious. Instant noodles as well <img
                            src="emoji/potate_wow.png" class="emoji" />, recently I
                        have started liking korean noodles affected by particular someone <img src="emoji/side_eye.png"
                            class="emoji" />.
                        also potatoes! Whether boiled, baked, raosted or fried potatoes I love them all <img
                            src="emoji/yum.png" class="emoji" />. Shawarma is also one of my favorite. I like chickens
                        but
                        not red meat, I was told to eat
                        it alot because healthy but I don't listen so I didnt <img src="emoji/smile3.png"
                            class="emoji" /> I
                        can never used to it. I like coffee more than tea, I name everything has coffee as coffee even
                        if
                        it only have little portion of it, I like it with a lot of milk and sugar I can never drink it
                        bitter. chocolate is the best desert

                        I don't know where to put that but one thing that I also like is the clouds, I love when they
                        are in
                        veryy pretty shape and color like an art <img src="emoji/wow3.gif" class="emoji" />, it's kinda
                        rare
                        to see that here we don't have a lot of cloudy days with mostly sunny and hot weather. I like to
                        take pictures of them (altho I forget to most of the time xD) here are some photos that I gladly
                        remember to capture.
